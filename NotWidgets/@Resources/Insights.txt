Where there is love there is life.

Life is a succession of lessons which must be lived to be understood.
There is nothing permanent except change.
The greatest mistake you can make in life is to be continually fearing you will make one.
It is better to fail in originality than to succeed in imitation.
Happiness is not a goal; it is a by-product.
The measure of who we are is what we do with what we have.

You can have it all. Just not all at once.
The most wasted of days is one without laughter.

The best revenge is massive success.
The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.
The most important thing is to enjoy your life - to be happy - it's all that matters.
Keep your eyes on the stars, and your feet on the ground.
Life is 10% what happens to us and 90% how we react to it.
You must do the thing you think you cannot do.
The best time to start was yesterday. The next best time is now.
Whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right.
A room without books is like a body without a soul.
Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.
What lies behind you and what lies in front of you, pales in comparison to what lies inside of you.
To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.
Life is made of ever so many partings welded together.
We must let go of the life we have planned, so as to accept the one that is waiting for us.
It is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves.
The most courageous act is still to think for yourself. Aloud.
The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams.
Everything you've ever wanted is on the other side of fear.
Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.
The privilege of a lifetime is being who you are.
Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.
It took me a long time not to judge myself through someone else's eyes.
The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new.
We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.
The only thing standing between you and your goal is the story you keep telling yourself as to why you can't achieve it.
Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.
The more you know who you are, and what you want, the less you let things upset you.
When you are content to be simply yourself and don't compare or compete, everyone will respect you.
If you want to be happy, be.
Happiness is not something you postpone for the future; it is something you design for the present.
To be beautiful means to be yourself. You don’t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself.
The most terrifying thing is to accept oneself completely.
You alone are enough. You have nothing to prove to anybody.
Don't ask yourself what the world needs; ask yourself what makes you come alive. And then go and do that. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.
The greatest thing in the world is to know how to belong to oneself.
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.
Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.
The goal isn't more money. The goal is living life on your terms.
The way I see it, if you want the rainbow, you gotta put up with the rain.
A wise man will make more opportunities than he finds.
If you don't like something, change it. If you can't change it, change your attitude.
It is never too late to be what you might have been.
You can't stop the waves, but you can learn to surf.
The first step toward success is taken when you refuse to be a captive of the environment in which you first find yourself.
Do not wait for leaders; do it alone, person to person.
Be faithful in small things because it is in them that your strength lies.
We must be willing to let go of the life we planned so as to have the life that is waiting for us.
There is no passion to be found playing small - in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living.
Success is not how high you have climbed, but how you make a positive difference to the world.
Happiness is not a possession to be prized, it is a quality of thought, a state of mind.
If you don't design your own life plan, chances are you'll fall into someone else's plan. And guess what they have planned for you? Not much.
The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way.
It's not what we have in life but who we have in life that matters.
The most beautiful things are not associated with money; they are memories and moments. If you don't celebrate those, they can pass you by.
The only source of knowledge is experience.
We do not remember days, we remember moments.
The more you praise and celebrate your life, the more there is in life to celebrate.
Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it.
Keep your face always toward the sunshine - and shadows will fall behind you.
Turn your face to the sun and the shadows fall behind you.
A single sunbeam is enough to drive away many shadows.
Live in the sunshine, swim the sea, drink the wild air.
Wherever you go, go with all your heart.
Adventure is worthwhile.
The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page.
Travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer.
Not all those who wander are lost.
The journey not the arrival matters.
The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes.
The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams.
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do.
Stop worrying about the potholes in the road and enjoy the journey.
Life was meant for great adventures and close friendships.
The most important thing is to enjoy your life - to be happy - it's all that matters.
The greatest wealth is to live content with little.
Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
The best things in life aren't things.
It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it.
You don't have to be rich to be happy.
Enough is a feast.
He is richest who is content with the least, for content is the wealth of nature.
To be content doesn't mean you don't desire more, it means you're thankful for what you have and patient for what's to come.
Happiness is not a matter of intensity but of balance, order, rhythm and harmony.
Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.
You cannot shake hands with a clenched fist.
A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal.
The best way to cheer yourself is to try to cheer someone else up.
We rise by lifting others.
The greatest good you can do for another is not just to share your riches but to reveal to them their own.
It's nice to be important, but it's more important to be nice.
You can't live a perfect day without doing something for someone without thought of reward.
No one has ever become poor by giving.
Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around.
The simplest acts of kindness are by far more powerful than a thousand heads bowing in prayer.
A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees.
The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched - they must be felt with the heart.
The only thing we never get enough of is love; and the only thing we never give enough of is love.
We can do no great things, only small things with great love.
Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver.
The greatest pleasure in life is doing what people say you cannot do.
You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
Do not wait to strike till the iron is hot; but make it hot by striking.
The only person who never makes a mistake is the person who never does anything.
Mistakes are the portals of discovery.
The greatest mistake you can make in life is to be continually fearing you will make one.
Take risks: if you win, you will be happy; if you lose, you will be wise.
A ship is safe in harbor, but that's not what ships are for.
Everything you want is on the other side of fear.
You can't cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water.
If you are not willing to risk the unusual, you will have to settle for the ordinary.
Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all.
To get something you never had, you have to do something you never did.
Don't be afraid to give up the good to go for the great.
He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life.
The biggest risk is not taking any risk. In a world that's changing really quickly, the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks.
Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.
What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail?
It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare; it is because we do not dare that things are difficult.
Leap and the net will appear.
Take the first step in faith. You don't have to see the whole staircase, just take the first step.
Action may not always bring happiness, but there is no happiness without action.
The path from dreams to success does exist. May you have the vision to find it, the courage to get on to it, and the perseverance to follow it.
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.
Dreams are the touchstones of our character.
The only place where your dream becomes impossible is in your own thinking.
Hold fast to dreams, for if dreams die, life is a broken-winged bird that cannot fly.
You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.
Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it.
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams. Live the life you have imagined.
Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world.
A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work.
The future depends on what you do today.
The secret of getting ahead is getting started.
The only way to achieve the impossible is to believe it is possible.
It always seems impossible until it's done.
Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.
Little by little, one travels far.
The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
The man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones.
Perseverance is not a long race; it is many short races one after the other.
Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out.
It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.
Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.
Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.
When you come to the end of your rope, tie a knot and hang on.
Fall seven times, stand up eight.
The difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength, not a lack of knowledge, but rather a lack in will.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.
The only guarantee for failure is to stop trying.
Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success.
Energy and persistence conquer all things.
Continuous effort - not strength or intelligence - is the key to unlocking our potential.
The secret of success is constancy to purpose.
The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.
Don't let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.
Believe you can and you're halfway there.
Whether you think you can or think you can't, you're right.
Your attitude, not your aptitude, will determine your altitude.
The only disability in life is a bad attitude.
The greatest discovery of my generation is that a human being can alter his life by altering his attitudes.
A positive attitude can really make dreams come true - it did for me.
The positive thinker sees the invisible, feels the intangible, and achieves the impossible.
Once you replace negative thoughts with positive ones, you'll start having positive results.
Every day may not be good, but there is something good in every day.
Happiness is an attitude. We either make ourselves miserable, or happy and strong. The amount of work is the same.
The sun himself is weak when he first rises, and gathers strength and courage as the day gets on.
If you want light to come into your life, you need to stand where it is shining.
Keep your face always toward the sunshine - and shadows will fall behind you.
Acknowledging the good that you already have in your life is the foundation for all abundance.
The more you praise and celebrate your life, the more there is in life to celebrate.
The only way to have a good day is to start it with a positive attitude.
The greatest day in your life and mine is when we take total responsibility for our attitudes. That's the day we truly grow up.
Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference.
Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.
We cannot change our past. We cannot change the fact that people act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude.
Your living is determined not so much by what life brings to you as by the attitude you bring to life; not so much by what happens to you as by the way your mind looks at what happens.
Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions.
Most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.
The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.
The greatest part of our happiness depends on our dispositions, not our circumstances.
It isn't what you have, or who you are, or where you are, or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about.
The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.
The happiness of a man in this life does not consist in the absence but in the mastery of his passions.
There is only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and that's your own self.
To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often.
The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be.
What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals.
The greatest good you can do for another is not just to share your riches but to reveal to them their own.
Your life does not get better by chance, it gets better by change.
If you don't like something, change it. If you can't change it, change your attitude.
Change your thoughts and you change your world.
The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.
We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.
The measure of intelligence is the ability to change.
It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.
The secret of change is to focus all of your energy not on fighting the old, but on building the new.
The first step toward change is awareness. The second step is acceptance.
All change is not growth, as all movement is not forward.
To exist is to change, to change is to mature, to mature is to go on creating oneself endlessly.
Life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes. Don't resist them - that only creates sorrow. Let reality be reality. Let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like.
The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance.
We must be willing to let go of the life we planned so as to have the life that is waiting for us.
Life is like a piano. What you get out of it depends on how you play it.
Life is a mirror: if you frown at it, it frowns back; if you smile, it returns the greeting.
The art of life is to live in the present moment.
Live the actual moment. Only this actual moment is life.
The secret of health for both mind and body is not to mourn for the past, worry about the future, or anticipate troubles, but to live in the present moment wisely and earnestly.
The ability to be in the present moment is a major component of mental wellness.
Realize deeply that the present moment is all you ever have.
Make the Now the primary focus of your life.
Wherever you are, be all there.
The past is a ghost, the future a dream, and all we ever have is now.
The here and now is all we have, and if we play it right it's all we'll need.
Forever is composed of nows.
You must live in the present, launch yourself on every wave, find your eternity in each moment.
With the past, I have nothing to do; nor with the future. I live now.
The power for creating a better future is contained in the present moment: You create a good future by creating a good present.
The only way to live is by accepting each minute as an unrepeatable miracle.
Today is life-the only life you are sure of. Make the most of today.
Don't let the past steal your present.
Let go of yesterday. Let today be your new beginning.
